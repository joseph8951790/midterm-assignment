# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Project Overview
.This project demonstrates a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions for a Node.js application. The pipeline ensures that every code change is automatically built, tested, and deployed efficiently..

## How to Set Up & Run Locally
### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
Start the Application

npm start
The server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Running Tests
This project uses Jest and Supertest for unit testing.

Run tests with:

npm test
Example Test Output:
vbnet

 PASS  test/server.test.js
 ✓ GET / should return Hello, CI/CD! (55ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total

Time:        1.56s
CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
Every push or pull request to the main branch triggers the following GitHub Actions workflow:

Workflow Steps
Checkout Code → Pulls the latest code from the repository.
Set Up Node.js → Installs the correct Node.js version.
Install Dependencies → Runs npm install.
Run Tests → Executes npm test.
Build Artifacts → Creates a ZIP file of the application.
Upload Artifacts → Stores the ZIP file as an artifact for later use.
You can check the pipeline status under the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.

Docker Support (Optional)
This project can be containerized using Docker.

Build & Run Docker Image
Build the Docker image:

docker build -t my-app .
Run the container:


docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

CI/CD Deployment Artifacts
If enabled, the CI/CD pipeline will upload build artifacts (ZIP file of the project) for deployment.
To download the latest artifact, go to GitHub → Actions → Workflow Runs → Download Artifacts.
