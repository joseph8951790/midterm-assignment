🚀 How to Run the Application Locally
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/joseph8951790/midterm-assignment.git
cd midterm-assignment
Install dependencies:

npm install
Start the application:

npm start
The app will run on http://localhost:3000/
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000/ to see "Hello, CI/CD!".
🧪 Running Tests
This project includes unit tests using Jest.
To run the tests, execute:


npm test
If successful, you should see "PASS" in the output.

🔧 CI/CD Pipeline - GitHub Actions
Every push to the main branch triggers the GitHub Actions CI pipeline:
✅ Build & Install Dependencies
✅ Run Unit Tests
✅ Upload Artifacts (ZIP file)
✅ Build & Push Docker Image

You can check the pipeline status under GitHub → Actions Tab.

🐳 Running the Application with Docker
1️⃣ Pull Docker Image
Once the pipeline completes, pull the latest Docker image from Docker Hub:


docker pull yourusername/midterm-assignment:latest
2️⃣ Run the Docker Container
Run the application in a Docker container:


docker run -p 3000:3000 yourusername/midterm-assignment
Now, open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

📦 CI/CD Pipeline File - .github/workflows/ci.yml
The full CI pipeline is defined in .github/workflows/ci.yml.
It includes:
✅ Checkout code
✅ Setup Node.js
✅ Run tests
✅ Upload artifacts
✅ Build & push Docker image
